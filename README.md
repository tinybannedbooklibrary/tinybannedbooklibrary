# Background

This digital library hosts books that are being banned or challenged by Republicans, Conservatives, and Christian Nationalists who are actively trying to ban information. People who normally say they are for "free speech" are against people having access to both historical and modern information about a broad range of topics. From LGBTQA+ rights and books about being queer, to the violent history of slavery, Jim Crow, and Black history in general. Trying to ban books that talk about the Japanese internment camps during WWII, or graphic novels about the holocaust. This is a direct attempt to block access to real and accessible information.

Information wants to be free, and no person should be denied access to books simply because someone doesn't agree with them. We should allow people to live their lives and be able to read about topics that might resonate with them. We can't ignore history or lie about it. We can't deny the humanity of people by invalidating who they love, or how they identify. We can't allow states, governments, and corporations to lie to people, feeding them misinformation for political gain. And so - in a small way, with a server in hand, or a website, or a blog, or a tweet, someone has decided to share the books that some think should be banned.

# Replication
This type of site can be replicated and modified. Want to make a new library to include links to specific things like trans rights and trans resources? Fork this library and add links to it. Want to include more links to specific information about social justice, Black history, and radical politics? Fork this repo and create one. 
This will make sure that information is being spread as much as possible, that this is distributed and decentralized. Make a copy in case this repo/site is taken down, fork this to do your own thing or to keep things updated. 
When forks are created, they can be merged with this site, so if you do create a new library list of resources of your own and it's good, it might be added into this one.
