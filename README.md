# Background

This digital library hosts books that are being banned or challenged by Republicans, Conservatives, and Christian Nationalists who are actively trying to ban information. People who normally say they are for "free speech" are against people having access to both historical and modern information about a broad range of topics. From LGBTQA+ rights and books about being queer, to the violent history of slavery, Jim Crow, and Black history in general. Trying to ban books that talk about the Japanese internment camps during WWII, or graphic novels about the holocaust. This is a direct attempt to block access to real and accessible information.

Information wants to be free, and no person should be denied access to books simply because someone doesn't agree with them. We should allow people to live their lives and be able to read about topics that might resonate with them. We can't ignore history or lie about it. We can't deny the humanity of people by invalidating who they love, or how they identify. We can't allow states, governments, and corporations to lie to people, feeding them misinformation for political gain. And so - in a small way, with a server in hand, or a website, or a blog, or a tweet, someone has decided to share the books that some think should be banned.

### Florida State Specific Lists
Florida is leading the charge in banning books. At the moment most school libraries are empty as the state has come in and removed large sections of books. 
The govenor of Florida, Ron DeSantis signed into law the "Stop Woke Act", which prohibits in-school discussions about racism, oppression, LBGTQ+ issues and economic inequity. This is a testing ground for more bills and for more laws to be passed. Republican city and state governments have been passing their own bills and laws to attempt to censor schools and public libraries but these efforts have been localized in specific areas.However, if republicans gain control of the government in the next national election, we can expect to see these books possibly banned from all schools and public libraries.

### Index of all books banned across states
This is taken from the PEN america list of banned books across almost every school district and state in the US. This list will be updated over time.
Source: [PEN Index of Banned Books](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTs_PB7KuTMBtNMESFEGuK-0abzhNxVv4tgpI5-iKe8/edit#gid=1171606318)

Breakdown of the book bannings: [https://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/](ttps://pen.org/banned-in-the-usa/)

PEN America categorized the types of stories — themes, characters, topics — reflected in the 1,145 titles that have been banned based on how these issues were identified by publishers or major reading databases. The results show a wide range of titles being targeted, with some consistent themes. Many of the categories below overlap.
Identities:
Titles that deal explicitly with LGBTQ+ topics, or have LGBTQ+ protagonists or prominent secondary characters have been a major target in the current wave of book bans. This is reflected in the Index, with 379 such titles (33%), including a distinct subset of 84 titles that deal with transgender characters and topics (7%).
        Fiction novels and non-fiction books with protagonists of color also made up a significant part of banned books in the Index, including 467 titles (41%).
        Books dealing with Jewish and Muslim characters and religious/ethnic themes have also been targeted, with 18 titles listed in the Index.
